The NY Times did plenty of stories during the Trump years about why people in the Midwest voted for Trump, and generally they felt too anecdotal and also too often seemed to ignore the real issue: racism. This book goes deeper than those articles. It confronts the racism, but also addresses the issues of our society as a whole. Closure of manufacturing plants may well have been good for the global economy, but it wasn't for parts of Ohio. All of the stories in the book are heartbreaking at times. They are frustrating. As with other books written since COVID started, you see how existing societal issues have only become much worse much more quickly, and it is maddening.",,,1,0

I miss watching those teams a lot and am happy we've gotten to learn more about the inner workings of the team in the last couple of years through The Last Dance documentary and books like this, but this was a bit much.

The initial sections of the book talk about projects and people I know, have followed, or look up to. With the focus of the book being on where innovation, creative thinking, and new ideas can come from to support government, I was already on board, but also was sold on this a long time ago. In the initial sections of the book, many of the examples were about people coming from outside government to create change - be it through a hackathon, a start up creating a useful tool, or maybe coming to work inside government (like me!). There are a lot of places where this has gone well, there are also troubling examples where it has not gone well. Sometimes there is also the perception that all we need is a set of new eyes on the problem with creative thinkers instead of bureaucrats, but generally that is not the solution, and can even be harmful if people don't understand the system and problem enough. <br/><br/>Though early on there are warnings about where these things can be problematic, I thought they were papered over a bit. I also kept wondering if the author would highlight folks who have always worked inside of government - this is where we always got the best ideas. So many staff just do their jobs every day but no one ever asks them how they might do things differently and they don't have an avenue to communicate opportunities for change or feel like it is too risky.<br/><br/>Finally, in the last section of the book, the author really hits a home run, calling out all of the exciting possibility of tapping internal staff resources, really making clear how these programs have to be set up to be impactful (use data and testing, be willing to shut down a failing program, have empathy, and more). I enjoyed the whole book, but if I were to assign a chapter to someone to read, it would be the final one.<br/><br/>If you're interested in innovation in government, this is a good one to put on your reading list.",,,1,0

When I learned more about his husband, Chasten, I was excited to find out that he grew up in Traverse City, MI near to where my parents live now. Just those connections would have been enough to make me like this book, I think, but the overall story is great as well. <br/><br/>Chasten describes his childhood, his relationship with his family, and then his responsibilities on the Presidential campaign trail in very open and honest ways. He persevered through a lot of challenges growing up, and then goes into details about the fun and exciting parts of being a spouse of a political candidate, but also the hard parts, too - you give yourself up and have to be worried about what you say and do at all times. <br/><br/>This is an insightful and funny book and well worth reading.

In reality, governments are organizations at the federal, state, and municipal level that help to make their communities run - be that fixing roads, putting out fires, or approving permits. To make that happen, the organizations need to be run well by competent managers and staff. <br/><br/>Greedy Bastards tells the story of that work happening in San Antonio, TX. While the major issue City Manager Sheryl Sculley focuses on in the book is police and fire union contracts, she also talks about taking on challenges, building support, and ultimately implementing change related to everything from reinvigorating the marathon in San Antonio to structuring half billion dollar bonds to improve the infrastructure of the City.<br/><br/>This book was interesting for me for a few reasons. After working for the City of Syracuse where there is an elected mayor but no City Manager, reading about Sculley's career as a City Manager was great. City Managers help to maintain operations of a city even when there is a mayoral change. Sculley also talked about a few issues that were very similar to the ones I worked on - specifically infrastructure maintenance. She made changes in the ways roads were maintained in a similar way to how we recommended. Most importantly, Sculley focuses on the value of public employees. So may times, government staff are viewed skeptically (both by people in and out of government). Sculley details her attempts to improve training and leadership opportunities, to build more trust, and also to put in place policies that make clear what is and is not allowed on the job.<br/><br/>All of this culminates in her taking on the police and fire unions, whose contracts were on track to crowd out all other municipal spending. While going great lengths to reiterate her respect for the work public safety staff do, she also makes the point that other municipal services are important, too. The inside-baseball level of detail she offers about how contracts are structured, why that is important, and also the amount of difficulty to make a change to these contracts was fascinating. It reminded me of when I sat in a Common Council meeting with only a few other people and they voted on measures that committed millions of public dollars to a program - really important decisions get made, often in public, but without much attention. I appreciate the level of detail in the book that brings attention to these kinds of issues. Having a strong and empathetic leader who knows how to identify challenging problems and then is willing to take them on is critical, and reading about it was inspiring. <br/><br/>I hope others will read this book as well to learn about the story in San Antonio, but also get a glimpse into what life is like in city government.",,,1,0

Working in City government at the time, it seemed ridiculous. Understanding the number of things governments do to allow a city to run on a day-to-day basis - fire departments, road repair, etc - that random people are not equipped to do or won't have the willingness to invest without some governing body requiring them to do so made me skeptical of a movement like the one in New Hampshire. Certainly government is not always perfect, and sometimes does things I disagree with, but seeing government in action also explained a lot of why things happen the way they do, and that there probably weren't a lot of totally alternative solutions that would work better.<br/><br/>This book, which is excellent and both funny and depressing at the same time, shows that when people are unwilling to submit to any government and regulations, things can go very wrong very quickly. Some people decide to start feeding bears, because, why not? Other people realize bears can be threatening so they buy guns to protect themselves and then kill the bears. Then other people get upset by the vigilantism and buy guns themselves. And then it is a mess. Sure, the state government agencies should do a better job regulating, but at the same time, the residents vote to cut funding and make threats. Of course, when things get really bad - like a fire breaking out in a historic church - they depend on other cities who do fund their fire departments to put out the fire. <br/><br/>The libertarian movements in New Hampshire remain, though in Grafton, where this book is set, the town has been gutted. I did appreciate that the saving grace in Grafton is that the library has remained. Though it receives almost no funding, this government-run entity that provides access to information to anyone continues to exist. I was able to read this book thanks to my own local library and I'm grateful for its existence as well as for the many public servants who make our country run every single day. ",,,2,0

There were a lot of things that frustrated me about when he was President, but in this book, he details the approach he took and is honest about where he feels he could have done better. He acknowledges many of the things I may have gotten frustrated about, and even recognizes that he too would have liked to do more, or at least he understood where people were coming from. <br/><br/>Even though this is a long book, it is hard to out down. It's a good look into what the job is like. I look forward to his next book that will detail the second part of his time in office.",,,1,0

Dickerson details the challenges with the job of President - it has grown to be too big, the person in the job is not set up for success, and we don't do a good job interviewing people for the job. I really enjoyed his delving into the details and considering how the office has grown and the challenges the Founders had in creating the position to begin with. That the Presidency, in part, was built with the character of George Washington in mind, it is easy to see how quickly the role can shift and change based on others in office who may not have had the same character as Washington at the time. <br/><br/>Having seen two Mayors manage an 1,800 person, $250 million organization and seeing how critical building a good team and having good leadership skills can be in that job, it is crazy to me that we don't ask questions of our Presidential candidates questions about organizational management approach. As Dickerson points out, we shouldn't be hiring a successful businessman to be the President, but the values and skills of a successful businessman could be useful for the job - and we just never see that skillset until the President is in office.<br/><br/>The book, understandably, tries to put the Trump Presidency in perspective. While Dickerson points out the many problems that Trump has created, he continuously presents a major mess Trump created, but then acknowledges the other presidents who have done something similar. At times, Dickerson also talks about the ways in which Trump has or hypothetically could have innovated the presidency. While it is certainly true that Trump has done things differently, these arguments often take the extra step of imagining if Trump was not completely inept and had an ability to actually build a strategy. To me, the arguments ended up grouping Trump in as a outside-of-the-norm President, but not a radically dangerous potential dictator (which he clearly is interested in being). Sure, using Twitter to communicate directly with the people is kind of like how FDR used the radio, but the differences so outweigh the similarities that the argument ends up being not useful. I wish Dickerson would have focused more on management and  the scope of the job, rather than delving into Trump quite as much. Additionally, the book was written just prior to COVID, so some of the comments on Trump's success with the economy just don't work anymore.<br/><br/>I'd recommend giving the book a read - the issues raised about the responsibilities of the office are important for all of us to consider.

In a country where there are many challenges, but an environment where hard things don't seem to get done, what are we to do? Buttigieg argues that we need to reinvest in trust. Without trust, we won't agree, and we won't do the hard things. He explores very specific and personal examples to him as well as larger historic examples. At the outset of the book, I first thought about how at a City level, releasing data to the public hopefully increases trust because the government is being honest about what it does day-to-day, good or bad. I was thrilled to see him call that out as a highlight of his own mayoral administration. His conclusions are ambitious and visionary, though hard to envision at the current extra cynical moment. <br/><br/>That said, I hope he continues to push on this issue and others - I appreciate his approach to governing.",,,1,0

It also is clear that the team could have done more - yes they might have been fired or hit a wall, but there was more they could have done. It is as much a story about how the law works and its important limits as how the respect for norms has been completely destroyed under this administration, but many of those that are supposed to check power continue to trust in the norms to help.

While the writing is dry, the argument is clear and the lessons of the book are enraging: through a history of both government-led discrimination as well as racism across the country, black people have been negatively impacted by this country's housing policies. The history of these racist policies create an ecosystem today, where even if the racist policies had been overturned or abandoned (which they largely haven't been), the impact on an entire race of people continues. Thinking of the many places I've lived throughout my life, you get a sense for how these policies impacted each city - why are the suburbs the way they are? What about the placement of single-family homes? How about the huge highway that destroyed a successful middle-class black neighborhood that continues to serve as an ugly blemish in my current home? <br/><br/>Over the last few years as I've thought about these issues, then this year in particular as we've watched Black Lives Matter protests emerge across the country, and finally through reading this book, it becomes clear that massive change and some form of reparations should occur. <br/><br/>In Syracuse, as we discuss taking down a portion of highway I-81 that destroyed the historic 15th Ward, one of the arguments has been to build a tunnel instead of an above ground viaduct (the current solution), in order to maintain a highway, but not disrupt the city. This solution doesn't work for a number of reasons, but many accepted the $4+ billion cost it could have brought. The generally accepted solution now is a ""community grid"" which will eliminate the highway and put a ground-level street in its place, allowing for more commerce and land development. The community grid solution should cost a little less than $2 billion. For Syracuse, perhaps the beginnings of righting the wrongs of the past would be to give back the land that was taken and destroyed, along with the $2 billion difference in project costs, to allow for even more development amongst the black community.

Since then, I've always been a fan of his, even though I didn't know very much about him. This book, which includes Gehrig's own words as it reprints a column he wrote with a series of 30 essays, gives you a sense for who Gehrig was. Humble and gracious, almost surprised by the success he had as one of baseball's all-time greats. It seems that his own reflections and stories were genuine, which makes this book a feel-good, quick read. Hearing stories about his teammates and other players from the time is fun - getting first person reflections on Babe Ruth, Ty Cobb, Walter Johnson, and Tris Speaker, among others, is great. For anyone who is a baseball fan, this is worth the read.",,,1,0

He's also from rural Virginia and writes about how the common viewpoint is that AI will eliminate jobs and leave many, especially those in places like rural Virginia, behind. His contention, though, is that AI will actually increase the number of jobs available. Some will need to retrain, but just like in previous industrial revolutions, technologies that have been thought to eliminate the need for workers actually increased opportunities. <br/><br/>I understand why he added in the focus on rural America, though it wasn't until he talked about broadband availability that I felt the perspective fit in well. The forward of the book was by JD Vance, author of Hillbilly Elegy (a book I didn't really enjoy), and I thought Scott tried to use that same frame occasionally, but unnecessarily. <br/><br/>I, too, am an optimist about AI, though I think the challenges are great. Scott calls out that our local elected leaders need to get educated on the policy considerations around AI, and incentives should be thought of just as much as restrictions. Almost weekly, we see ways that AI can be hyper-problematic (facial recognition systems that are not accurate, predictive policing gone wrong, improper use of data). Scott acknowledges those problems and says they need true focus, though I don't know that there were concrete solutions that he offered.<br/><br/>His section on broadband was really best, and the entire book could have been based just on internet access. Without it, AI doesn't work because transmission of data is so important to powering AI systems. He focuses on the need in rural America - which is absolutely true. There are now numerous federal and state programs incentivizing broadband access. He could have also focused on lack of broadband access in cities, too. This is not because of a lack of internet cables, but instead because of cost. In Syracuse, about half of the households in the city don't have broadband and a computer at home. In the poorest parts of the city, only about 25% of the households have broadband and a computer. This will need to change, too.<br/><br/>I liked his ideas about low-skilled work that could increase because of AI - jobs like data labeling. I've long though that jobs like hanging and maintaining sensors around cities will also be critical work where someone doesn't necessarily need a college degree. Any of these types of jobs, though, need creative people guiding educational curriculum. Scott recognizes that even programs with more economic potential, like computer science classes, are not available to enough students. So training for low-skilled jobs enables by the AI economy have definitely not become mainstream. <br/><br/>Last, his call for federal investment in an ""AI-moonshot"" program, similar to the space program makes a lot of sense. In another book called ""Jump Starting America"", the authors cite programs that came during World War 2 and the space program that gave the nation focus, invested heavily in academic research and enabling companies to build products based on that research, and ultimately established and grew the economy across the United States. Similar programs around AI could help renew focus and grow a new economic sector - the race against other countries investing heavily in AI is happening right now.<br/>",,,1,0

It makes me angry that I have no recollection of learning about this event during any my years of schooling. History like this should be included in any basic history class in every school across the country. This is a story about a community that had built itself up to be middle class, had overcome many of the challenges of racism and the history of slavery to still build a thriving neighborhood. But that success only made white people in the community angry, and so they decided to eliminate that community. If we saw that kind of action happening in any other country, we would condemn it. Here, we've covered it up.<br/><br/>Given the current protests against police brutality, it is hard not to find comparisons with what happened here. The police actively avoiding protecting the black community members during the burning (or joining in). The language in the 1920s about the good black people who had accepted their place in life versus the bad black people that were arguing for equality and pushing for equal rights. We have not come too far, and we continue to cover up our history.<br/><br/>It was also difficult to avoid thinking about my own city, Syracuse, while reading this book. People in Syracuse never burned down a neighborhood and actively murdered that neighborhood's residents, but the 15th ward in Syracuse was similar to the Greenwood neighborhood in Tulsa - a successful black community. But when it came to a choice about where to build an interstate highway, where was the perfect location? The 15th ward. The area of the city that housed a successful black community was flattened so people could get in, out, and through the city faster. That area of the city is now amongst the most concentrated areas of poverty for people of color in the entire country. There may not have been a burning, but people's homes and lives were still stolen. We've only recently started to talk collectively about that history here. The highway now needs to be replaced - it is old and falling down. Some of the people who helped to make the decision to put the highway where it is are still alive, and continue to advocate for its replacement - another ugly, damaging structure. To make matters worse, rebuilding the highway would require more buildings to be knocked down. <br/><br/>Thankfully, it seems that we will be able to get rid of that highway and rebuild the community - but it will need to be built in such a way to give opportunity to those who were negatively impacted most. Given the history, we should be talking about how to repay those who had their community stolen from them. We talk about people pulling themselves up by their boot straps. They did, the government decided that wasn't good enough, or it was too threatening. Given how history has played out, and the direct connection from events like Tulsa or interstate highway installations have led to generational poverty, we should be pushing for reparations. I don't know how it would work, but the time is overdue, even if it makes some of us more uncomfortable.<br/><br/>Everyone should read this book, even though the details are difficult to contend with.

You also potentially get a chance to see the next great player, all while acknowledging that most people on the field will never make it, but they still get to play a great game for work. This book does a wonderful job detailing all of those things with the setting being the longest game ever played.

As a huge West Wing fan, the final chapters are extra special as he details his experience on the show. Rob Lowe's character Chris Traeger is a favorite of mine, especially since I work in local government. Even though that character is a bit over the top, through this book you can see how Rob Lowe brings a similar passion to his life every day.

Who decides? Who decides who decides?</b><br/><br/>This was a comprehensive book that did a deep dive into how we should all be concerned about the ways in which the data we create every day is collected and used to more efficiently sell us stuff, and ultimately, Zuboff argues, create behavioral modification.<br/><br/>My job is to help my organization figure out how to use data to make better decisions. I have seen the ways that counting things, looking at trends, and predicting outcomes can make the organization better. As we look at bringing on more technology that can help us better understand the things happening on a day-to-day basis, I have no doubt that we will have more ability to be guided to a good choice.<br/><br/>BUT...I also know how easily that can switch. Without considering the bias of data collected, those trend or predictive analyses can become horribly biased and cause harm to people. Without understanding the secondary uses of data collected by new technologies, people can lose their privacy without even knowing it.<br/><br/>A few things that stuck with me from the book:<br/>- She talks about how Karl Marx considered how power goes to those that control the means of production. But in a Surveillance Capitalist society, it is not the means of production, but the owners of the means of behavioral modification that hold power - and that is increasingly companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, and Amazon. <br/><br/>- She says that people don't know what they are sharing, how it is being used, and also people don't know their own preferences. Additionally, apps that offer choices to protect privacy often work less well if those choices are selected. Add to that the long license agreements people generally just accept without even thinking, and we are set up for a system of massive data collection with very little knowledge about exactly what that means. <br/><br/>- She talks about how there is no longer any way to be ""off stage"" and to be yourself. She specifically focuses on young people and how things like Facebook are specifically developed to be almost addictive to the user, especially kids and young adults. Prior to this age of surveillance capitalism, you might be able to hide in your room or go on a walk and not need to be worried about being tracked, followed, marketed to, and evaluated. That no longer exists.<br/><br/>The book is excellent, it is scary and concerning. It was also very long. That meant she could go into deep detail, but it also likely means not as many people will read it, which is unfortunate. I likely won't stop using most of the services I use because to some degree they are a necessary part of life. It will make me think about the policy I work to set in my own job to have better transparency around the kinds of technologies we deploy, data we use, and decisions we automate thanks to that data. <br/><br/>These are conversations we need to have more of, and quickly. Highly recommend others read the book.<br/><br/>",,,1,0

Outside of a few decent life lessons (push yourself out of your comfort zone), the book was over the top, and the author came off as selfish and not willing to learn. To continuously put yourself in positions of harm is dangerous. Yes, he made it through. Fortunately, he had support systems that helped get him to a hospital and care for him. I appreciated his advice about how to find time to get into shape - like riding a bike to work, running at lunch time, etc. He also got divorced several times and makes no mention of his child, even when he's lying on his perceived death bed. The misogynistic language was also unnecessary and  ruined parts of the book that might have otherwise had good pieces of advice.<br/><br/>No doubt he overcame extremely difficult life experiences - ones that I thankfully can't relate to - but I just don't know that the things he learned translate well, or are necessarily good advice ultimately. It is only at the end when he finally realizes he needs to calm down and not completely overdo things without any preparation that it seems like he finally thrives and finds comfort in his life.<br/><br/>The audiobook commentary was a neat idea, but not well executed. The things they talked about during the ""podcast"" sections could have been included in the book, or they weren't all that interesting. It didn't add much for me.",,,1,0

The story of growing a successful organization using data, but also learning how to build in qualitative understanding to determine which decisions should be made is fascinating to me. Major League Baseball is different than local government in a lot of ways, but using data as a strategic asset to help guide decisions is something organizations in both worlds can prioritize.

And though it is overwhelming to think about how many systems need to change, in fact there are very tangible things we can all do (including not eating meat, eggs, and cheese before dinner) that would have a huge impact. He acknowledges that not eating meat, dairy, and eggs is extremely challenging, but does a good job with a wide range of examples to argue that if the choice is a future on this planet or not, then changing eating habits is not a big deal. <br/><br/>I think the arguments are made well, though they are repetitive, and at some times he seems to be writing in a stream of conscience that feels more like a blog post than a book. But, in the end, the subject matter is too important, and his descriptions of the challenges that we face are described so well, that it left me feeling like there is no choice but to try to do more.",,,1,0

Running the data team for a municipality, I often just wish we could look at the numbers and have them guide us to a decision. But as the authors find out in their pursuit to manage a team by the numbers, sometimes the numbers aren't there, even if they are people may not listen, and there is rarely a clear black-and-white answer to the question. <br/><br/>Using data to make decisions is critical with any team or organization, but without considering the people behind the numbers, and how the decisions could affect the people involved, you aren't doing your job right.<br/><br/>",,,1,0

This book goes into great detail about the people who came up with the ideas and innovations that enabled AT&T to deliver service ""better, cheaper, or both"". Whether thinking about the transistor or the wooden poles, Bell Labs had a hand in their creation. <br/><br/>This book is a great primer on how innovation can thrive - it turns out smart people with access to the right problems with the support of management and a budget to allow for creative thinking can lead to great things.<br/><br/>I found it interesting to think through how the government both enabled AT&T and thus Bell Labs - through a monopoly and war funding - and then broke up the company through deregulation. Without the monopoly, innovation couldn't have happened in a vacuum. Without constant pressure of deregulation, AT&T would not have allowed access to its patents, giving others the chance to build on their initial successes. <br/><br/>As we today think about gigabit fiber, 5G, and billion dollar venture capital start ups, we can trace much of the initial thought back to the laboratories in Murray Hill, NJ.",,,1,0

From the simple facts that I went to the same elementary school as Mayor Pete when I lived in South Bend, that his husband grew up less than an hour from where my parents live now, that he is a mayor who governs his city in much the way I strive to work each day at my job in municipal government - data driven without forgetting the people behind the numbers. South Bend is a city with just 100,000 residents, but it is similar to so many other rust belt cities across the country, including Syracuse. A former manufacturing hub, it saw job and population loss in the late 20th century. Now, though, the city has seen a Renaissance, largely based on the vision of its mayor - to view its liabilities as assets and push the city using progressive values. <br/><br/>It's hard to imagine a mayor of a small for becoming President, but through my own understanding of the work that had happened in South Bend combined with all the details in this book, if anyone can do it, it is Mayor Pete. His understanding of how to manage a government and connect with people who depend on government services make him just as qualified as anyone else.<br/><br/>I look forward to following his campaign and career.

I knew of his career at the Washington Post and his talent - highlighted by the Pulitzer he won.<br/><br/>Throughout the book, I found myself tense, angry, and sad. This boy grew up and defined the white nationalist movement to a point that its ideology ended up being spoken by our current President among other nationally elected politicians and other leaders. That damage has resulted in the tragedies in Charlottesville and Dylan Roof's massacre in a church. <br/><br/>But the book also cover's Derek Black's transformation from a white nationalist to someone who disavows the movement completely. The combination of kindness and caring from some close friendships (people who embrace him despite his views, who also happen to be minorities), along with the pressure from others who feel he deserves no respect because of those views, ultimately push him to change. <br/><br/>Derek Black's views changed and the way he changed is a good lesson in how to approach people with views that seem both horrible and unthinkable. The problem is that it seems his white nationalist views are spreading fast and with a louder platform than before. How to change these viewpoints for all of these new followers is a challenge we will all continue to deal with for years to come. ",,,1,0

As sensors and other internet of things devices become available, a city can benefit because information can be collected in an autonomous fashion that previously would have either not been possible, or required too much staff time.<br/><br/>In my city, almost half of the households do not have a broadband subscription or a computer. In the poorest Census tracts, about 80% of households lack connectivity. <br/><br/>Fiber is only available to a small portion of the population in my city, and it costs almost $100 per month, if you're lucky enough to have the wires run to your house.<br/><br/>This book does a masterful job discussing the challenges cities face when fiber is not available to all at a reasonable price. It also tells inspiring and exciting stories about the potential for fiber and innovation. Though fiber does not suddenly end poverty or solve challenges related to education or health, it does enable new economies that could help better a citizenry.<br/><br/>The book is a call-to-action of sorts to local and federal governments, and to all of us, to demand fiber that is available broadly and comprehensively, and for a reasonable price.<br/><br/>The United States ahas already fallen behind countries like South Korea and Sweden when it comes to fiber deployment.
